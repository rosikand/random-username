# random_usernmame
A simple program that generates random usernames wrapped in a Flask app. The random username is a string consisting of an english adjective
followed by a noun and a number between 1-99--all generated randomly.

The main motivation for this project was to gain experience with Flask, web applications, and manual routing. 

## Use the program
You can either use the program by downloading and running the `run.py` file on your local server or you can, conveniantly use it on the following website: [http://randomusername.pythonanywhere.com/](randomusername.pythonanywhere.com). 


## References
- The program selects the random adjectives and nouns from the two text files `common-adjectives.txt` and `common-nouns.txt` which were taken from here. 
- The web server hosting is done through [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).
