# ðŸŽ² Random Username Generator
A simple program that generates random usernames wrapped in a Flask app. The random username is a string consisting of an english adjective
followed by a noun and a number between 1-99--all generated randomly.

The main motivation for this project was to gain experience with Flask, web applications, and manual routing. 

## Use the program
You can either use the program by downloading and running the `run.py` file on your local server or you can, conveniantly use it on the following website: [randomusername.pythonanywhere.com](http://randomusername.pythonanywhere.com/). Visual:
